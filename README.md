Grip
==============

A shell based expansion of git's capabilities
--------------

Since git commands are at the core of Grip, 
you can still use git without having to worry about compatability issues.

**Working commands:**
- grip new
- grip startr
- grip artistic
- grip init

**Commands in development:**
- grip me
 
**How to install and use Grip**
--------------
Installing grip is a cinch.
Download the files files from this repository and navigate to the folder.  
Once inside the folder run the command 'sh install.sh'.  
This should create a new folder in your $HOME directory called grip.  
The 'grip' folder houses the actual grip script as well as accompanying information grip requires.  
The 'install.sh' also adds an alias to your .bash_profile for the word 'grip'.  
The alias connects to the script in the '$HOME/grip' folder.  
You can now simply type 'grip <grip command>' and let the magic happen!
